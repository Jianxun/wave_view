## Response:
Thought for 39 seconds

Dr. Zhu has asked me to analyze the codebase for "wave\_view" that they authored, with the goal of improving its API and adding new features. I’ll explore the GitHub repository to better understand the code, including the README and possibly additional documentation. I’ll look for the language (likely Python) and the library's current functionality, then propose structured suggestions for improvements. I’ll also make sure to clearly reference any insights from the repository. Let's dive in!

The user previously asked to see the repo, and now they want me to analyze it. I'll need to open the repository’s root and read the README and possibly check the directory tree.

I’ll try accessing the repo directly since the search results didn’t match, possibly due to the repo being private or not found properly. I'll scroll to the README to better understand the project before proceeding with the analysis.

I’ll attempt to open the README file again, but this time adjusting the response length setting to medium. By doing this, I should get enough content to capture key details and example usage. That way, I can analyze it thoroughly and better assist with the analysis, especially for the wave\_view code that the user wants to examine.

I'll open the README file again with medium response length to capture key details and examples, like features and architecture. This will help me get a better sense of the project. Next, we need to take a closer look at the API code, so I'll head over to the `src` modules, particularly `wave_view/api.py`, to analyze the code and suggest improvements where necessary.

I’ll adjust the response length to medium and open the README file again to capture key details about features and usage examples. This will help me understand the project architecture. Then, I’ll look at the `api.py` file to analyze its code pattern and suggest improvements. However, it might be better to check out `core.plotter.py` next, as it might have more relevant features for analysis. Let's take it step by step!

I’ll set the response length to medium and open the README file to review feature details and usage examples. After that, I'll take a closer look at the `api.py` file to analyze its structure and suggest improvements. However, considering the task requires reviewing features, it might be better to explore `core.plotter.py`. I'll also check out `core.reader.py` and the `config` file for a better overview of the project. Let's dig into these modules.

I’ll open the README first to capture the essential details and usage examples, especially focusing on features and architecture. Then, I'll find ways to improve the API code by reviewing the `api.py`. It would be a good idea to explore `core.plotter.py` next, as that might offer more insight into the project's features. I'll also take a look at `core.reader.py` and the `config` file to get a full picture.

I've reviewed the README and explored the code in `api.py`, `core.plotter.py`, `core.reader.py`, and the `config` file. Based on this, I suggest several improvements and features. These include adding interactive features, multi-figure YAML lists, and integration with ASDL. Suggested enhancements include:

1.  Device-specific frequency domain overlays (Bode magnitude/phase).
2.  API improvements like DataFrame interface, lazy loading, and caching.
3.  CLI command for quick plotting.
4.  Color palettes and theme support.
5.  Pluggable readers for additional formats.
6.  Interactive dashboards for multiple graphs.
7.  Streaming support for large waveforms.
    

Done

Below is a code-base “health-check” and a set of concrete, design-driven ideas you can use to move **wave\_view** toward the next level. I focus first on what exists, then on _why_ each proposed change will matter for your larger ASDL/EDA vision.

* * *

1 · Current architecture at a glance
------------------------------------

| Layer | Key public objects | What they do | Observations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Core** | `SpiceData` (reader) | Wraps `spicelib.RawRead`, normalises trace names to lower-case, lazy accessor for each signal | clean, but tightly coupled to spicelib [raw.githubusercontent.com](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jianxun/wave_view/main/src/wave_view/core/reader.py) |
|  | `PlotConfig` | Loads YAML/Dict, validates `"X"` + `"Y"` blocks, warns on missing signals | good start; validation is runtime-only and ad-hoc [raw.githubusercontent.com](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jianxun/wave_view/main/src/wave_view/core/config.py) |
|  | `SpicePlotter` | OO façade: load data → load config → add processed signals → `create_figure()` (Plotly) | figure assembly done “by hand”, multi-axis layout logic already in place [raw.githubusercontent.com](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jianxun/wave_view/main/src/wave_view/core/plotter.py) |
| **Simple-API** | top-level functions in `api.py` (`plot`, `load_spice`, `explore_signals`, config helpers) | what 90 % of end-users will touch | strong validation, Jupyter detection, but growing monolith [raw.githubusercontent.com](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jianxun/wave_view/main/src/wave_view/api.py) |

Strengths ✦ interactive Plotly visuals, case-insensitive signals, processed-signal hooks.  
Limitations ✦ no schema/IDE autocompletion for YAML, no CLI, only single-figure configs, no batch/sweep visualisation, spicelib lock-in.

* * *

2 · API ergonomics – quick wins
-------------------------------

| Pain-point | What to change | Why it helps |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Verbose `plot()` call signature | Introduce a **dataclass-based `PlotSpec`** that bundles `raw_file`, `config`, `processed_data`, `renderer`, etc. Provide `.plot()` and `.show()` methods on it. | Reduces positional-arg overload; paves the way for fluent chaining and IDE hints. |
| Runtime YAML errors | Ship a **JSON-Schema** for the config and validate with `jsonschema` at load-time. Emit `rich` console errors that point to the YAML line. | Gives users immediate, editor-integrated feedback; unlocks future VS Code/Obsidian autocompletion. |
| Coupling to spicelib | Abstract `Reader` as an interface; keep `SpiceRawReader` and later add `NgSpiceCSVReader`, `SpectreFsdbReader`, … | Future-proofing: same plotting API for other simulators and for your _pytest-based sweeping harness_. |
| Figure customisation | Expose Plotly `layout` and `update_traces` kwargs in `plot()` (with pass-through) | Users can tweak colours, dashes, secondary y-axis units without dropping to the low-level API. |
| Single-figure limit | Bring back multi-figure YAML **optionally** via `"figures:" [ ... ]` while keeping the simple case untouched. | Avoids copy-pasting configs for sweeps; each figure becomes a `PlotSpec` element. |

* * *

3 · Feature roadmap (ordered by impact/effort)
----------------------------------------------

1.  **CLI entry-point `wave_view`**  
    `wave_view sim.raw --cfg plot.yaml --open` → opens browser OR saves `plot.html`.  
    _Why?_ fits inside VS Code tasks and automated reports.
2.  **Parameter-sweep visualiser**  
    Accept a list/glob of `.raw` files; group by corner/seed; draw envelopes, min/mean/max bands.  
    _Why?_ directly supports your PVT & Monte-Carlo pytest harness.
3.  **Lazy, memory-mapped reader** for gigantic transient dumps  
    Stream chunks to Plotly’s WebGL traces; avoids 10 GB RAM blow-ups.
4.  **Interactive markers & annotations**  
    YAML:
    ```yaml
    markers:
      - x: 2.3e-6
        y: "v(out)"
        text: "Peak glitch"
    ```
    Use Plotly `add_vline`/`add_annotation`.  
    _Why?_ documents design-insight inline, perfect for Obsidian export.
5.  **Pydantic-powered processed-signal registry**  
    Users define small functions in a `signals.py` file; auto-discover via entry-points. Encourages reuse of metrics (gain, PSRR, phase margin).
6.  **Theming & presets**  
    Ship `dark`, `journal`, `presentation` themes (just Plotly templates) selectable via YAML or API. Useful for slide decks vs. lab notebooks.
7.  **Obsidian integration hook**  
    After `fig.show()`, write a PNG + a `.md` snippet with front-matter linking back to the raw file & YAML. Aligns with the “save pasted figures” workflow you outlined earlier.
    

* * *

4 · Deeper architectural evolutions
-----------------------------------

| Idea | Rationale | Tech sketch |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Move config & processed-signal logic to **Pydantic models** | Typed configs, auto-docs, programmatic composition. | `class Axis(BaseModel): label:str; signals:dict[str,str]; scale:str='linear'` |
| Replace homemade axis-layout math with **Plotly subplots** helper | Less code, gains auto-spacing, shared x-axis control. | `make_subplots(rows=n, shared_xaxes=True, vertical_spacing=0.03)` |
| Create a **`FigureBuilder` plug-in system** | Let users register new figure types (e.g., Bode, FFT) without touching core. | Use `pluggy` or entry-points. |
| Add a **`Dataset` abstraction** (signal meta, sweep dims) | Handles corner, temp, seed axes; re-uses x vector where identical; ideal for hierarchical Monte-Carlo results. | Design like xarray but lighter. |

* * *

5 · Suggested next steps
------------------------

1.  **Decide on the JSON-Schema vs. Pydantic path** – whichever you pick will shape validation and editor tooling.
2.  **Prototype CLI**: it is <100 LoC thanks to `click` – ships instant value.
3.  **Refactor `plot()` into `PlotSpec`**; deprecate old signature but keep it for compatibility.
4.  **Open tracking issues** in the repo and tag them `api`, `feature`, `refactor` so contributors (and future you) have a roadmap.

### What would you like to tackle first?

If any of the above resonates—or if you’d like sample code for, say, the CLI stub or the JSON-Schema—let me know and we can dive straight in.

## Prompt:
I want to discuss about the parameter sweep visualizer. We need a lot of flexibility here.

# raw file metadata
Assume the simulation orchestration tool create a dictionary of metadata of the raw files. Including:
- simulation case number (integer)
- raw file paths 
- parameters used for each simulation case

#data grouping and filtering
When we visualize them we should be able to filter out waveforms by parameters. For example, I only want to see the 85C cases, we can spec 
“””
filter: 
  temperature: 85
“””
If we want to group the results by parameters:
“””
group:
  - temperature
  - corner
“””
For legends we should provide a template like
“””
legend: “{corner}_{temperature}”
“””


We can also set the legend with a template

## Response:
Thought for a few seconds

The user wants to dive into designing a parameter sweep visualizer with metadata and grouping. I believe I can propose a YAML config design that includes grouping and filtering

Done

Below is a concrete, design-first proposal for the **parameter-sweep visualiser**—focusing on _how_ each feature will feel to you as a user, _why_ it matters for day-to-day RF/analog work, and _what_ the underlying implementation can look like in `wave_view`.

* * *

1 · Data model — treat sweeps as a tiny dataframe
-------------------------------------------------

**Why?** Once every raw file has a row of metadata, grouping, filtering, and legend templating all collapse to familiar dataframe operations—fast, composable, and easy to unit-test.

```text
+-----------+-------------------------+-------------+----------+----------+
| case      | path                    | temperature | corner   | vdd      |
+-----------+-------------------------+-------------+----------+----------+
| 0         | sim/0.raw               | 25          | tt       | 1.8      |
| 1         | sim/1.raw               | 85          | tt       | 1.8      |
| 2         | sim/2.raw               | 25          | ss       | 1.62     |
| …         | …                       | …           | …        | …        |
+-----------+-------------------------+-------------+----------+----------+
```

_Implementation sketch_

```python
import pandas as pd
meta_df = pd.DataFrame(meta_dict_list)         # one row per raw file
```

This becomes the single source-of-truth passed to plotting helpers.

* * *

2 · YAML-first UI for quick experiments
---------------------------------------

Your proposed syntax translates nicely into a **`SweepSpec`** config model:

```yaml
# sweep_plot.yaml
slice:                     # 1️⃣ optional arbitrary “where” clause
  temperature: 85
  vdd: 1.8

group:                     # 2️⃣ how to split figure into traces
  - temperature
  - corner

legend: "{corner}_{temperature}°C"    # 3️⃣ template for each trace

aggregator: envelope       # 4️⃣ min/max fill; other options: mean, median
x: time                    # 5️⃣ which column is x-axis (aliases allowed)
y: vout                    # 6️⃣ which signal(s) to plot
logx: false
```

_Why this layout?_

1.  **`slice`** is a declarative filter—no code, no quoting.
2.  **`group`** and **`legend`** together define how multiple cases map to traces.
3.  **`aggregator`** tells the visualiser whether to plot every case individually (default), overlay semi-transparent traces, or pre-compute statistical bands (min/mean/max).
4.  Everything else (`x`,`y`,`logx`, styling) mirrors the existing single-file spec—minimal cognitive load.
    

### CLI feel

```bash
wave_view sweep meta.json --spec sweep_plot.yaml --open
```

### In-code feel

```python
from wave_view.sweep import SweepSpec, SweepPlotter
spec = SweepSpec.from_yaml("sweep_plot.yaml")
fig  = SweepPlotter(df=meta_df, spec=spec).figure()
fig.show()
```

* * *

3 · Legend templating (string.Formatter under the hood)
-------------------------------------------------------

`"{corner}_{temperature}°C"` is fed the _first_ row of each group; any column name is legal. Internally:

```python
legend = legend_template.format(**row.to_dict())
```

_Edge case_: mixed values within a group → you’ll see placeholders like `{temperature}` in red in the legend, prompting you to revisit the spec.

* * *

4 · Colour & style mapping that scales
--------------------------------------

_Default_: Plotly’s automatic discrete colour cycle keyed by the full legend label (guarantees distinct groups).

_Advanced (optional in YAML)_

```yaml
palette:
  temperature:
    25: blue
    85: red
linestyle:
  corner:
    ss: dot
    tt: solid
    ff: dash
```

Palette keys match column names; values override Plotly attributes. If absent, fall back to auto.

* * *

5 · Three visual modes you’ll actually use
------------------------------------------

| Mode | aggregator | Visual cue | Typical use-case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Overlay** (default) | none | 1 trace per case, 30 % opacity | Spot outright failures, look for outliers |
| **Envelope** | envelope | Fill min/max band; line = mean | PVT corner compliance (e.g., gain stays in spec) |
| **Stat-table** | mean + σ | Renders a `pandas` table next to figure | Regression reports for CI pipelines |

Switching is one YAML line; the underlying `SweepPlotter` just delegates to different helper methods.

* * *

6 · Internals — minimal but extensible
--------------------------------------

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    meta_df -->|slice| df_filtered
    df_filtered -->|groupby(keys)| gb
    gb -->|for each| load_signals
    load_signals --> traces
    traces -->|aggregator| final_traces
    final_traces --> PlotlyFigure
```

_Key decisions_

*   **Lazy data loading** – `load_signals` yields an iterator of `(meta_row, SpiceData)` so only the groups being plotted touch disk.
*   **Plug-able aggregators** – ABC `Aggregator` with `EnvelopeAgg`, `MeanAgg`, `RawAgg`.
*   **No hard Plotly coupling** – `SweepPlotter` returns an abstract `Figure` object; current implementation is Plotly, future can be Altair or Matplotlib.
    

* * *

7 · Next micro-steps
--------------------

1.  **Write the `SweepSpec` Pydantic model** (≈40 LOC).
2.  **Prototype group-by legend logic** with dummy sinewaves to validate UX.
3.  **Benchmark lazy reader on a 100-case Monte-Carlo run**—adjust chunk size if needed.
4.  **Document**: two worked examples (PVT, MC) in `examples/`.
    

* * *

### Where would you like to start?

Let me know if you’d like sample code for the `SweepSpec` model, a quick prototype of the envelope aggregator, or guidance on hooking this into your pytest testbench harness.

## Prompt:
I like the dataframe operations on the metadata table. Elaborate.

## Response:
Thought for 6 seconds

The user is asking for more details on handling sweep metadata as a dataframe. I’ll explain how to use dataframe operations for filtering, grouping, and creating derived columns. I’ll cover key tasks like designing the schema (flexible for any parameters), and show examples of operations such as `groupby`, `pivot`, `slice`.

Additionally, I'll provide code examples using pandas and explain how this integrates with YAML specifications for slicing and field grouping. I’ll also consider performance aspects, especially with pandas versus polars.

I

Done

Below is a deeper-dive into the **“metadata-as-DataFrame”** pattern—how it works, why it scales, and concrete idioms you can lift straight into `wave_view`. I’ll walk through the lifecycle from load → slice → group → aggregate → serialize.

* * *

1 · Canonical schema
--------------------

```python
import pandas as pd

cols = [
    "case",                 # int  – monotonic index from orchestration tool
    "path",                 # str  – absolute/rel path to .raw
    # ----- parameter columns (arbitrary) -----
    "temperature", "corner", "vdd", "monte_seed",
    # ----- derived columns (optional)  -----
    "temp_class",           # str  – e.g. "<0°C", "0-85°C", ">85°C"
]

meta_df = pd.DataFrame(records, columns=cols).set_index("case")
```

_Rules of thumb_

*   **Every sweep dimension gets its own typed column** (`int`, `float`, `category`, or `string[pyarrow]`).
*   Keep **`path`** in the row so later stages can lazy-load the raw file.
*   Derived/bucketised columns live alongside raw parameters; they’re cheap to recompute with `assign()`.
    

* * *

2 · Ergonomic query helpers
---------------------------

Instead of scattering ad-hoc boolean masks, wrap the common verbs:

```python
def slice_df(df, selector: dict):
    """Return df rows where every key == value (exact match)."""
    mask = pd.Series(True, index=df.index)
    for k, v in selector.items():
        mask &= df[k] == v
    return df[mask]

def group_df(df, keys: list[str]):
    """Return a pandas.groupby object keyed by `keys`."""
    return df.groupby(keys, sort=False, observed=True)
```

### Example

```python
sel = {"temperature": 85, "vdd": 1.8}
df85 = slice_df(meta_df, sel)
gb   = group_df(df85, ["temperature", "corner"])
```

_Result_ – `gb` is ready for:

```python
for group_key, subdf in gb:
    # group_key -> (85, 'tt')   e.g.
    # subdf     -> DataFrame of N cases
```

* * *

3 · Legend templating via `group_key`
-------------------------------------

A tiny formatter function turns the tuple into a readable label:

```python
from string import Formatter

def templated_label(fmt: str, key, df) -> str:
    # `key` is the tuple returned by groupby
    if not isinstance(key, tuple):
        key = (key,)
    mapping = dict(zip(df.index.names, key))
    return fmt.format(**mapping)

fmt = "{corner}_{temperature}°C"
label = templated_label(fmt, group_key, df85)
```

Because `groupby` preserves the grouping columns as the index, the lookup is O(1) and requires no extra state.

* * *

4 · Aggregators as pluggable callables
--------------------------------------

```python
class Aggregator:
    def __call__(self, traces: list["SpiceData"]) -> dict[str, np.ndarray]:
        raise NotImplementedError

class RawAgg(Aggregator):
    """Return one trace per `SpiceData` unchanged."""
    def __call__(self, traces):
        return {i: t for i, t in enumerate(traces)}

class EnvelopeAgg(Aggregator):
    """min/mean/max envelope."""
    def __call__(self, traces):
        ys = np.stack([t.y for t in traces])
        return {
            "min": ys.min(0),
            "max": ys.max(0),
            "mean": ys.mean(0)
        }
```

A plotting layer can now do:

```python
agg  = EnvelopeAgg() if spec.aggregator == "envelope" else RawAgg()
data = agg([SpiceData(p) for p in subdf.path])
```

No aggregator needs to know about DataFrames or Plotly—solid separation of concerns.

* * *

5 · Performance patterns for >10 k Monte-Carlo runs
---------------------------------------------------

| Concern | Technique |
| --- | --- |
| **Metadata blow-up** | Store parameters as `category` dtype: `meta_df["corner"] = meta_df["corner"].astype("category")`. |
| **Disk I/O** | Keep only file _paths_ in `meta_df`; read waveforms lazily inside the aggregator. |
| **RAM** | For min/max/mean bands you don’t need to keep every trace: incremental reduction works → read → reduce → discard. |
| **Large YAML** | The slice/group spec stays tiny; all heavy lifting occurs in DataFrame ops. |

* * *

6 · Integrating with your existing CLI/API
------------------------------------------

```python
def load_meta(path: str | Path) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Read JSON/CSV/Parquet metadata into the canonical DataFrame."""
    ext = Path(path).suffix
    if ext == ".json":
        return pd.read_json(path).set_index("case")
    elif ext == ".parquet":
        return pd.read_parquet(path).set_index("case")
    # ...etc.

def main(meta, spec):
    df    = load_meta(meta)
    df    = slice_df(df, spec.slice)
    g     = group_df(df, spec.group)
    fig   = SweepPlotter(g, spec).figure()
    fig.write_html(spec.output) if spec.output else fig.show()
```

A small CLI wrapper (`click`, `typer`, or `argparse`) turns this into:

```bash
wave_view sweep meta.parquet --spec sweep_plot.yaml --out pvt.html
```

* * *

7 · Optional power-ups
----------------------

*   **Vectorised “where” clauses** – leverage `DataFrame.query("temperature==85 & vdd>=1.7")` to support compound filters in YAML.
*   **Multi-index** – convert `group_df(...).obj` into a MultiIndex for lightning-fast lookups in post-processing metrics.
*   **Polars backend** – an adaptor layer can expose the same helpers using Polars for Arrow-native speed; interfaces stay identical.
*   **Metadata caching** – hash the slice/group spec → cache the list of paths; repeated plotting in notebooks becomes instant.
    

* * *

### Ready to prototype?

I can drop in:

*   a **reference implementation** of the helpers above (<100 LoC);
*   a real-world example notebook that slices a PVT sweep and draws envelope plots;
*   or a **unit-test scaffold** that fakes `.raw` files with NumPy sinusoids so the CI runs <1 s.
    

Tell me which deliverable you’d like next, and we’ll make this concrete.

## Prompt:
The sweep visualization can be implemented in stages. Let’s nail the single raw file plotting API with the sweep visualization in mind. 

How would you refactor the API?

## Response:
Thought for 5 seconds

The user wants to refactor the API for single raw file plotting, targeting sweep visualization. The current base involves core elements like SpiceData, PlotConfig, and SpicePlotter, with basic API functions. To anticipate future multiparameter sweeps, we could propose introducing a `PlotSpec` model using dataclass or Pydantic for cleaner handling. A spice reader abstraction and builder pattern might help with scalability. My approach will focus on providing a design-first solution aligned with Pythonic principles, offering code sketches for clarity without relying on external tools.

Done

Below is a **clean-slate sketch** that keeps today’s single-file convenience _and_ lays the rails for tomorrow’s multi-file sweep engine. All names are illustrative—feel free to bikeshed.

* * *

1 · Core domain objects (one file, zero sweeps)
-----------------------------------------------

| Class | What it holds | Why it matters later |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`WaveDataset`** | • `signals`: `dict[str, np.ndarray]`  
• `t`: shared time/freq axis  
• `meta`: free-form dict (corner, temp, vdd…) | Same object can also represent **one row** in the future sweep DataFrame. |
| **`PlotSpec`** | Declarative config  
`x: str` (alias to `t`)  
`y: list[str]`  
`style`: dict per curve  
`axes`: list/dict for multi-axis | Exactly the same spec can be _broadcast_ to N datasets in a sweep. |
| **`FigureBuilder`** | Stateless utility that turns `(datasets, spec)` → Plotly `Figure` | Provides `build_one()` and will later get `build_group()` that accepts `GroupedDatasets`. |
| **`WaveView`** _(façade)_ | Thin wrapper offering `.plot()`, `.show()`, `.save()`, `.to_html()` | Keeps 90 % of end-users in a 1-liner; implements **dunder-call** for notebook ergonomics. |

### Minimal happy-path today

```python
import wave_view as wv

data = wv.WaveDataset.from_raw("sim.raw")
spec = wv.PlotSpec(y=["vout", "vin"], logx=False)

fig  = wv.WaveView(data, spec).show()     # <–– notebook in-place
```

* * *

2 · Key design choices that future-proof the API
------------------------------------------------

### 2.1 `WaveDataset` owns **metadata**

```python
ds = WaveDataset.from_raw(
        "sim.raw",
        meta=dict(case=0, temperature=85, corner="tt", vdd=1.8)
     )
print(ds["vout"])          # `Mapping` behaviour: ds["vout"] → 1-D array
print(ds.meta["corner"])   # trivial lookup
```

_Why?_ In a sweep, a list/Series of `WaveDataset` is fully self-describing; no separate side-table needed.

* * *

### 2.2 `PlotSpec` is a **Pydantic dataclass**

*   Good editor autocompletion
*   JSON/YAML round-trip (`.model_dump()`, `.model_validate_json()`)
    

```yaml
# spec.yaml
y: [vout, vin]
x: time
style:
  vout:
    color: red
    dash: dot
logx: false
```

Load it:

```python
spec = PlotSpec.model_validate_file("spec.yaml")
```

* * *

### 2.3 Pure-function **builders**, not stateful plotters

```python
plotly_fig = FigureBuilder.build_one(ds, spec)
```

_Why?_ The same builder will later gain `build_many(datasets, spec, aggregator="envelope")`.

* * *

3 · Backwards-compatibility layer
---------------------------------

Keep your old sugary function:

```python
# BEFORE
plot("sim.raw", cfg="plot.yaml")

# AFTER – same import path, new internals
from wave_view import plot
plot("sim.raw", cfg="plot.yaml")
```

Implementation:

```python
def plot(raw_file, cfg=None, **kwargs):
    ds   = WaveDataset.from_raw(raw_file)
    spec = PlotSpec.from_file_or_kwargs(cfg, **kwargs)
    return WaveView(ds, spec).show()
```

No breakage; power users can drop to the new objects when needed.

* * *

4 · Layout of the refactor (incremental PR steps)
-------------------------------------------------

1.  **`wave_view/dataset.py`**
    *   `WaveDataset` + helpers (`from_raw`, `from_dataframe_row`, `.to_parquet()`).
2.  **`wave_view/spec.py`**
    *   `PlotSpec` (Pydantic) + `load_yaml`, `dump_yaml`.
3.  **`wave_view/figure.py`**
    *   `FigureBuilder.build_one()` (copies code from current `SpicePlotter`).
4.  **`wave_view/api.py`**
    *   wrappers: `load()`, `plot()`, `show()`, `save()`.
    *   mark old classes with `@deprecated` decorator that points to docs.
5.  **Smoke tests / notebooks** proving parity with existing examples.
    

* * *

5 · One‐liner cheatsheet for reviewers
--------------------------------------

```text
WaveDataset  –>  data + meta
PlotSpec     –>  declarative intent
FigureBuilder–>  renders one or many datasets
WaveView     –>  comfy façade for notebooks & CLI
```

* * *

6 · Why this pays off for the sweep engine
------------------------------------------

*   **Grouping**: a simple `groupby` over a list of `WaveDataset.meta` dicts.
*   **Legend templating**: `"{corner}_{temperature}".format(**ds.meta)`.
*   **Aggregators**: operate on `list[WaveDataset]`.
*   **CLI**: `wave_view plot sim.raw --spec spec.yaml` stays as intuitive as ever; later `wave_view sweep meta.csv --spec sweep.yaml` is symmetrical.
    

* * *

### Ready to code?

If you’d like a _concrete_ starter PR layout—file stubs, class skeletons, and a migration checklist—just say the word and we can flesh it out line-by-line.

## Prompt:
I’m thinking about how to compile multiple figures into an html report. Propose a solution.

## Response:
Thought for 9 seconds

It seems the user wants to compile multiple figures, including Plotly visualizations, into a single HTML report. To do this, I could suggest creating a tool like a ReportBuilder that will gather PlotSpec pages and compile them into a static HTML report, using Dash, Panel, or just HTML with embedded JSON or static images. It should support templates, collapsible sections, and metadata. I would also ensure there’s a CLI command for generating the report, while offering an export option beyond PDFs.

I’m suggesting using Jinja2 to generate the HTML, with Plotly figures embedded using `fig.to_html(full_html=False, include_plotlyjs="cdn")`. A potential approach is using Dash for an offline, interactive report, or relying on Plotly's offline HTML outputs. The solution should involve a ReportBuilder to handle figure/dataset specs, using YAML for structured input. The HTML generation will leverage a Jinja2 template, ensuring it’s flexible for user-specific reports and easily shareable, integrating with platforms like Obsidian.

Done

Below is a **design-ready blueprint** for turning many `wave_view` figures into a polished, single-file **HTML report**. All moving parts are incremental: you can land them in small PRs without breaking today’s notebook workflow.

* * *

1 · Mental model
----------------

```
PlotSpec × WaveDataset  ─┐
                         │  →  Plotly Figure  →  ReportBuilder → report.html
Slice / Group / Agg  ────┘
```

*   **`FigureBuilder`** (already proposed) keeps responsibility for a _single_ figure.
*   **`ReportBuilder`** becomes a _composer_: it assembles any number of Plotly snippets, wraps them in an HTML template, and emits a ready-to-share file.
    

* * *

2 · Declarative **`ReportSpec`** (YAML / JSON / Pydantic)
---------------------------------------------------------

```yaml
title: "OTA PVT Sweep – June 2025"
author: "Dr. Jianxun Zhu"
theme:  "dark"        # optional – maps to CSS class

sections:
  - heading: "DC Transfer Curves"
    notes: |
      • Spec: linearity ±1 %  
      • VDD = 1.8 V, Temp = 25 °C
    figures:
      - spec: dc_transfer.yaml        # ← PlotSpec path
        dataset: sim.raw              # optional override
  - heading: "AC Gain vs Temperature"
    slice: { corner: tt }             # ← sweep filter (optional)
    group: [ temperature ]
    legend: "tt_{temperature}°C"
    spec : ac_bode.yaml
  - heading: "Monte-Carlo Phase Margin"
    aggregator: envelope              # min / mean / max
    spec : pm_mc.yaml
```

_Why this works_

*   The **same fields** (`slice`, `group`, `legend`, `aggregator`) that the sweep engr can already parse—no new DSL.
*   Everything else (`heading`, `notes`, `theme`) is pure presentation.
    

* * *

3 · Code sketch
---------------

```python
from wave_view import WaveDataset, FigureBuilder
from wave_view.report import ReportSpec, ReportBuilder, load_meta

# 1. Load sweep metadata once
meta_df = load_meta("meta.parquet")

# 2. Parse report spec
rspec = ReportSpec.model_validate_file("report.yaml")

# 3. Collect Plotly HTML snippets
fig_snippets = []
for sec in rspec.sections:
    datasets = select_datasets(meta_df, sec)      # slice + group
    figs = [FigureBuilder.build_one(ds, sec.spec_obj)
            for ds in datasets]
    fig_snippets.append((sec, [f.to_html(full_html=False,
                                         include_plotlyjs=False)
                               for f in figs]))

# 4. Render full HTML
html = ReportBuilder.render(rspec, fig_snippets,
                            include_plotlyjs="cdn")  # or "inline"

with open("report.html", "w") as fh:
    fh.write(html)
```

### Tiny CLI wrapper

```bash
wave_view report report.yaml --meta meta.parquet --out pvt_report.html
#            ^command ^spec            ^sweep df              ^output
```

Powered by `click` or `typer`; stays symmetrical with `wave_view sweep`.

* * *

4 · HTML template (Jinja2)
--------------------------

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>{{ spec.title }}</title>
  {% if include_plotly == "cdn" %}
    <script src="https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-2.35.0.min.js"></script>
  {% endif %}
  <style>
    body { font-family: Inter, sans-serif; margin: 2rem; }
    .dark { background:#111; color:#eee; }
    h1, h2 { margin-top: 1.5em; }
    .notes { font-size: 0.9em; opacity: .8; }
  </style>
</head>
<body class="{{ spec.theme }}">
  <h1>{{ spec.title }}</h1>
  <p class="notes">Author: {{ spec.author }} &nbsp;|&nbsp; Generated: {{ timestamp }}</p>

  {% for section, figs in fig_snippets %}
    <h2>{{ section.heading }}</h2>
    {% if section.notes %}<p class="notes">{{ section.notes }}</p>{% endif %}
    {% for f in figs %}
      {{ f|safe }}
    {% endfor %}
  {% endfor %}
</body>
</html>
```

_Toggle_ **`include_plotlyjs`**

*   `"cdn"` → slim HTML (~20 kB) that fetches Plotly once online.
*   `"inline"` → fully self-contained HTML (~3–4 MB) handy for email attachments or Obsidian vaults.
    

* * *

5 · Power-user hooks
--------------------

| Need | How to support |
| --- | --- |
| **Tables & metrics** | `ReportSpec.sections[].tables:` list of pandas DataFrames dumped with `df.to_html(classes="table")`. |
| **Per-section CSS** | `section.class: "two-column"` → comes out as `<div class="two-column">…</div>` |
| **PDF export** | Optional `--pdf` flag: call `weasyprint report.html report.pdf`. |
| **Obsidian embed** | After build, emit a snippet: `![[attachments/pvt_report.html]]` and copy file to vault’s `/attachments/`. |

* * *

6 · Delivery plan (3 PRs)
-------------------------

| PR | Scope | Rough LOC |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | `ReportSpec` Pydantic + Jinja template scaffold | 150 |
| **2** | `ReportBuilder.render()` + CLI `wave_view report` | 200 |
| **3** | Sweep-aware dataset selection + unit tests w/ dummy figs | 120 |

Unit tests can stub Plotly figures with a tiny HTML string; CI stays <5 s.

* * *

### Ready to build?

Let me know if you want:

*   the full file tree stub for PR 1 (spec model + template),
*   a demo notebook that calls `wave_view.report` end-to-end, or

Happy to get as concrete as you need!

## Prompt:
Ok, the report is probably higher priority than parameter sweep. 

Where are the data saved in the self-contained html report?

## Response:
Thought for 12 seconds

The user asks where the data is saved in a self-contained HTML report. Specifically, they want to know how data like traces and plots are embedded. Plotly figures in the HTML export contain the data as serialized JSON inside the figure’s JavaScript. The data is included within a script tag, typically formatted like "Plotly.newPlot('id', {data: \[...\]})". The data arrays can become large if there are many points, and this can impact performance. To reduce file size, we might consider optimizing or limiting the data embedded.

For big datasets, compressed base64 ZIP strings or external data files are options. In self-contained offline HTML, data is embedded within `<script>` tags. Plotly offline, for instance, uses JSON arrays inside a `<script>` to construct figures. We might use `fig.to_html` to return the figure's HTML snippet with data embedded. For large datasets, alternatives like WebGL scattergl traces, binary compressed data, or downsampling might help reduce file size.

For large datasets, we can either compress and store data as base64 zipped strings or use external files loaded via fetch. In offline HTML, Plotly figures embed data within `<script>` tags using JSON arrays. Using `fig.to_html()`, we can create snippets containing figure data and layout within a `div` followed by a `script`. Other strategies might involve using compressed binary data, Blobs, or referencing external files, though that wouldn't keep everything self-contained in the HTML.

### Where the numbers actually live in a self-contained `report.html`

When you call

```python
fig.to_html(full_html=False, include_plotlyjs=False)
```

each **Plotly snippet** that `ReportBuilder` drops into the template looks (schematically) like this:

```html
<div id="fig-0"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">
  var fig0 = {
      "data": [
          {"type":"scattergl",
           "x":[0.0,1e-9,2e-9,…],          // ← your raw time vector
           "y":[0.00,0.12,0.23,…],          // ← the trace samples
           "name":"tt_85°C"}
      ],
      "layout":{…},
      "config":{…}
  };
  Plotly.newPlot("fig-0", fig0.data, fig0.layout, fig0.config);
</script>
```

*   The **`<div>`** is just the placeholder that will become the canvas.
*   The **`<script>`** tag stores the whole figure **as JSON text** inside the HTML file; that JSON contains every sample point.
*   On page load, Plotly’s runtime (either inlined or pulled from the CDN) reads that JSON and re-creates the interactive plot in the `<div>` element. [plotly.com](https://plotly.com/python-api-reference/generated/plotly.io.to_html.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

If you choose `include_plotlyjs="inline"`, another `<script>` block (~3 MB) that contains the **entire Plotly library** is added at the top of the file, making the report fully offline. With `include_plotlyjs="cdn"` the library is _not_ embedded; the HTML is ~3 MB smaller but needs an internet connection. [plotly.com](https://plotly.com/python/interactive-html-export/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* * *

### Practical consequences

| Question | Answer / Best-practice |
| --- | --- |
| **File size** | Every data point is repeated verbatim in the HTML. A few figures with 100 k points each can easily reach tens of MB. |
| **Memory in browser** | Data are loaded into JavaScript arrays on first render. Modern browsers handle a few MB fine, but 10⁵–10⁶-point sweeps per figure can strain RAM. Down-sample before export or switch traces to `scattergl`. |
| **Security** | All data are visible as plain text in View Source. If that’s a concern, export a slim HTML and ship raw files separately. |
| **Obsidian compatibility** | Because everything is inline, you can drop `report.html` in `/attachments/` and embed it with `![[report.html]]`; no extra assets required. |

* * *

### Options if your traces are _huge_

| Technique | How it works | Trade-offs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Signal decimation** | Pre-sample to ≤2 k points per trace before `to_html()` | Fastest; acceptable for visual inspection, not for data mining |
| **Zip + Base64** | Store zipped NumPy → base64 string and `pako.inflate()` in JS | Adds a 2-3 kB decompression shim; shrinks file by 3–6× |
| **External JSON files** | Keep HTML slim; `fetch()` the data at runtime | Breaks “single-file” promise unless you inline JSON via `<script type="application/json">` |
| **Lazy fetch from raw file** | Store a link and load samples on demand server-side | Requires a server; not an option for offline sharing |

* * *

### Recommended default for `wave_view` reports

```python
fig.to_html(full_html=False,
            include_plotlyjs="cdn",   # slim file
            default_width="100%",     # responsive
            post_script="Plotly.relayout(gd, {hovermode:'x unified'})")
```

*   **Why**: keeps each snippet small (~20–30 kB for 5 k points), the final  
    report stays e-mail-able, and anyone behind a corporate firewall can still  
    flip `include_plotlyjs='inline'` for a 100 % offline copy.
    

* * *

#### Next steps you might adopt right now

1.  **Add a `downsample=<int>` knob** to `PlotSpec` (`0` = no decimation).
2.  **Expose `inline` / `cdn` / `directory` switch in `ReportSpec`** so you can choose per report.
3.  **Document file-size heuristics** (e.g. “1 figure @ 10 k pts ≈ 70 kB with CDN mode”) in the README.
    

Let me know if you’d like implementation snippets for built-in decimation or Base64-compressed traces.
