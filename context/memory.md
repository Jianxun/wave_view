# Project Memory

## Project Overview
A prototype spice simulation waveform viewer widget for IPython notebooks. This widget will allow users to visualize and interact with SPICE simulation waveforms directly within Jupyter/IPython notebook environments.

## Current State
- Project structure setup complete
- Context management system implemented
- Virtual environment and dependencies configured
- Created experimental notebook for testing Plotly widgets
- Ready to begin widget framework evaluation

## Key Decisions
- Using standard Python package structure with `src/` layout
- Implementing context management for multi-session continuity
- Following test-driven development approach
- Target platform: IPython/Jupyter notebooks
- Added Plotly to dependencies for widget experiments

## Open Questions
- Which visualization library to use (matplotlib, plotly, bokeh)?
- Widget framework choice (ipywidgets, voila, custom)?
- SPICE file format support requirements
- Performance requirements for large waveform datasets

## Recent Progress
- Created `prototype/notebooks/plotly_widget_experiments.ipynb` for hands-on testing
- Notebook includes examples of: interactive plotting, widget controls, measurement tools, and performance testing
- Added plotly to requirements.txt
